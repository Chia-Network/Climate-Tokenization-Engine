# Climate Tokenization Engine init file for systemd. To
# start the Climate Tokenization Engine service
# using systemd, execute `systemctl start
# climate-tokenization-engine@<USERNAME>`
# where <USERNAME> is the Linux user you wish to run
# the Climate Tokenization Engine as. Normally you'll
# run Climate Tokenization Engine on the same system
# as the Chia Wallet and Data Layer and you need to run
# Climate Tokenization Engine as the same user as Chia.

# For example, if running Chia as the ubuntu user
# with your $CHIA_ROOT directory at /home/ubuntu/.chia,
# then start Climate Tokenization Engine with the command
#
# `systemctl start climate-tokenization-engine@ubuntu`
